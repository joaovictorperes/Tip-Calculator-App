## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid e Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Lighthouse

### What I learned

<p>In this project I tried to learn the mobile-first workflow. At the beggining it was confusing, but searching some tips on stackoverflow and programmer's advices on Youtubem, I realize what was necessary to make the calculator first for small screens, after for the desktops.</p>
<p>I liked this experience because I was not sure how to do that and also where to find the information to finish the project.</p>
<p>There are so much content on websites, Youtube and the support at the Slack and, that all those things make me feel more confident to try new things, like:</p>

- Add and remove elements with JavaScript
- Add and remove classes of the HTML with JavaScript
- Edit css style with JavaScript
- Make the conditions of the operation of the calculator, including the erros and show to the user what was wrong
- Block some elements of the HTML according the erros that was showed, etc

<p>All this problems were appering in the calculator, some hard to sold, others confusing to think, but in every one of then I develop my logic in HTML, CSS and specialy in JavaScript, because that's why I choose project.</p>

### Continued development

<p>In the next projets I will keep to focus on mobile-first workflow, because it is a very good way to start an organize the site.</p>
<p>Also I'm going to make the websites much accessible as possible, including semantic tags, aria-labels, etc in the HTML.</p>
<p>Some things that I will improve are the organization of the commits, code and make a path of what I have to do construct the site and just after this beggin to code.</p>
